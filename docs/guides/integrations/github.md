# GitHub

Tuinly's GitHub integration offers a seamless and secure solution for interacting with your repositories, managing workflows, and automating essential tasks. Powered by the Tuinly GitHub App, this integration enables you to quickly bootstrap application source code, operationalize configuration as code, and much more—all while maintaining a high level of security and control. With the GitHub App, you can ensure fine-grained permissions and direct integration with your development pipelines.

For more detailed information on how GitHub Apps work, please refer to the [official GitHub Apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps).

> **Important**: To maintain security and prevent conflicts, each GitHub Organization can only be linked to a single Tuinly tenant. However, a single Tuinly tenant can integrate with multiple GitHub Organizations, allowing you to manage multiple codebases and teams efficiently from one platform.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

- GitHub Organization: For more detailed instructions on creating an GitHub Organization, please refer to the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations).

> **Important**: As of today, Tuinly only integrates with GitHub Organizations. If you want to link your personal account or you have any concerns, please [reach out](https://urls.tuinly.com/contact) — we're happy to work through the details with you.
