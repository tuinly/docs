# Integrations

Your Tuinly account is only as powerful as the integrations you enable. By connecting your account with external tools, services, or applications, you can:

- Bootstrap new application source code in your preferred Source Code Management solution (e.g. [Github](/guides/integrations/github))

- Deploy a cloud landing zone with your cloud provider of choice (e.g. [AWS](/guides/integrations/aws))

- Self servce CI/CD processes by the click of a button (e.g. [GitLab Pipelines](/guides/integrations/gitlab))

- Streamline observability instrumentation, from simple out-of-the-box monitoring solutions (e.g. [AWS CloudWatch](/guides/integrations/aws)) to advanced observability suites (e.g. [Dynatrace](/guides/integrations/dynatrace))

... and much more.
